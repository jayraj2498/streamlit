Main Script (main.py):
This is the main script of the project where the Streamlit application is defined.
It contains functions to interact with the user interface and make predictions.
The user interface allows users to input features of banknotes and get predictions on their authenticity.
Classifier Model (classifier.pkl):
This is the pre-trained machine learning model used for predicting the authenticity of banknotes.
It's typically a binary classifier trained on historical data with features such as variance, skewness, curtosis, and entropy.
Project Assets (Images, etc.):
Any additional assets used in the project, such as images for the Streamlit app's interface, can be stored here.
README File (README.md):
This file contains information about the project, including a description of the dataset, how to use the application, and any other relevant details.
Dependencies (e.g., requirements.txt, environment.yml):
If necessary, you can include a file listing all the dependencies required to run the project.
Project Information:
Project Description:
This project is a machine learning application developed using Streamlit.
It predicts the authenticity of banknotes based on various features extracted from images of the banknotes.
Dataset:
The dataset contains information about banknotes, including features such as variance, skewness, curtosis, and entropy, along with the corresponding class labels indicating whether the banknote is authentic or fraudulent.
Machine Learning Model:
The machine learning model used in the project is a binary classifier trained on historical data.
It takes as input the features of a banknote and predicts whether it is authentic or fraudulent.
Streamlit Application:
The Streamlit application provides a simple user interface for users to interact with the machine learning model.
Users can input the features of a banknote and get instant predictions on its authenticity.
The application is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with clear instructions and feedback for the users.
Output:
The output of the application is the prediction of the authenticity of the banknote.
The prediction is typically represented as a binary value (0 for fraudulent, 1 for authentic), which is displayed to the user.
Additionally, the output is mapped to more descriptive labels (e.g., "Authentic" or "Fraudulent") for better user understanding.
Overall, this project aims to demonstrate the application of machine learning in predicting the authenticity of banknotes and provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the model.
